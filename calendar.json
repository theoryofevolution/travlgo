            "description": "Mt. Takao is the most popular climbing spot in the Kanto area, located about 50 kilometers west of the city center. It is a wonderful mountain, designated as Michelin three star spot along with Mt. Fuji in 2007, and it\u2019s a national park where you can leisurely enjoy mountain hiking even on a day trip. The mountain has been especially important to Japanese since 744, when Emperor Shomu commanded the creation of Yakushiji, a famous temple, and thereby encouraged followers to come to the mountain. Known as one of Tokyo's best outlooks, the view from the observation deck is of a big panorama overlooking the Kanto Plain, with skyscrapers in the distance. Leave the hustle and bustle of the city for a rejuvinating day where you'll connect with nature in a spiritual setting.",
