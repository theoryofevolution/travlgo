        "description": "The Original Tour covers the most popular neighborhoods of San Francisco to provide the best local introduction to the city. The tour starts in the heart of the financial district underneath the Transamerica Pyramid. After our group introduction in SF's smallest redwood park, we'll weave our way through the secret side of downtown to see parts of the city that even locals often miss! As we explore the historical Barbary Coast we share family stories of the Wild West during the Gold Rush years. After learning about these lawless times, we'll make our way into North Beach (our Little Italy) as we sample a plethora of snacks and introducing our groups to local community businesses. We'll end the tour in our most authentic historic neighborhood, Chinatown. In Chinatown we'll visit stores and marketplaces that sell unique items, both dead & alive(!), while trying delicious authentic dim sum. Finally, we'll finish up by visiting the fortune-cookie factory and the \"living room\" of Chinatown.",
