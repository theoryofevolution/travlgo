We'll discover Yoda and how Lucasfilm came to be a part of the Presidio. \nNote: Tour starts at one location and ends at another\n\nWe'll show you \"then and now\" photos of the park and tell stories of the soldiers and civilians that lived here as well as some who are buried here. On the main post, we\u2019ll chat about what life was like for soldiers who lived here and discover the tragic, fiery fate that befell a very famous Army general. \n\nMany tours drive in a rush through the Presidio on their way to the bridge... our tour slows down to walk, and shows you what you're missing!\nFeel free to check out details on our website \n",
