        "description": "Arad was once in the middle of the Austrian \u2013 Hungarian Monarchy. Germans, Hungarians, Romanians, Serbs, and Jews have lived here peacefully over the centuries and built together a culture that is hard to imagine anywhere else! \nWe will talk about the golden age dating back to the beginning of the 20th century when most of the buildings we admire today were built. We will explore the multiculturality of the city through the stories about those who inhabited it and we will learn about heroes undressed by their uniforms in the Romanian \u2013 Hungarian Reconciliation Park! History, architecture and the stories of those who walked this way and lived over the centuries in a fascinating environment!\n",
